Mono Tools:
----------

Mono Tools is a collection of programs and utilities for use with Mono.


Building:
--------

Building should be as simple as:

    ./autogen.sh [typical configure flags, such as --prefix=PREFIX]
    make
    make install


Notes:
-----

  * Subdirectories:

    To ensure that a directory is actually configured and built, add the 
    directory to the file "subdirs".  This file contains the names of 
    directories that should be configured and built as part of normal "make" 
    handling.

    If the subdirectory has an "autogen.sh" file, it will be executed when the
    top-level "autogen.sh" file is executed.

  * VPATH and "make distcheck"

    VPATH and "make distcheck" are not likely to be supported.  They make the
    assumption that the files produced by the build process (such as
    Makefiles, object files, binaries, etc.) can be separate from the source
    tree.

    While ideal, this effectively requires the use of Automake/Autoconf
    by all sub-projects; maintaining this by hand is an odious requirement.

    It is fairly probable that many, if not most, programs included in
    mono-tools WILL NOT be using Automake or Autoconf, but normal Makefiles
    (or even NAnt build scripts).

    Thus, VPATH will not be supported at this time.


Building an RPM:
---------------

1.  Run "autogen.sh", which creates and runs "configure", etc.

    ./autogen.sh

2.  Make the RPM:

    sudo make dist-rpm
