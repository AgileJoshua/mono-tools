Mono Tools:
----------

Mono Tools is a collection of programs and utilities for use with Mono.


Building:
--------

Building should be as simple as:

    ./autogen.sh [typical configure flags, such as --prefix=PREFIX]
    make
    make install


Notes:
-----

To ensure that a directory is actually configured and built, add the directory
to the file "subdirs".  This file contains the names of directories that
should be configured and built as part of normal "make" handling.

If the subdirectory has an "autogen.sh" file, it will be executed when the
top-level "autogen.sh" file is executed.


Building an RPM:
---------------

1.  Run "autogen.sh", which creates and runs "configure", etc.

    ./autogen.sh

2.  Make the RPM:

    sudo make dist-rpm
