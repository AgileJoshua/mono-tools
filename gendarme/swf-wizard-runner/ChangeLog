	* swf-wizard-runner.mdp: New. MD project file. It compile but won't
	execute properly (since I don't know how to set the resource name 
	correctly).
	* Makefile.am: Use resgen2

	* GuiRunner.cs: Fix rule loading so it works when the wizard
	is invoke using a script.
	* Wizard.cs: Always save an existing copy, if existing, of any
	report type (instead of re-generating it). Remove check for 
	InvokeRequired since this (often but not always) breaks on MWF.
	* Wizard.Designer.cs: Enlarge vertical space for logo (not sure
	why this is required on MWF).
	* Properties/Resources.resx: Make logo path unix-friendly.
	* Makefile.am: New. Allow to build the wizard from the 
	command-line.
