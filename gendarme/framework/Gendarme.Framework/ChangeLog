	* MethodSignature.cs: Modify API to ensure objects are immutable 
	once created since we expose them as read-only in MethodSignatures.
	Note: we need to rule to automate this check!

	* MethodSignature.cs: Override ToString as this can be useful when 
	reporting errors/warning.
	* MethodSignatures.cs: Add GetHashCode and ToString, remove virtual 
	from Equals (since it should happen to any of them, even "new" ones).

	* MethodSignatures.cs: Change [No|One|Two]Parameter[s] to private
	to avoid ArrayFieldsShouldNotBeReadOnlyRule on self-test.
