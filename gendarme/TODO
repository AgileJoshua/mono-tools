TODO

// in no particular order (or level of details)

* more rules!

* GUIs, including:
	* standalone (Gtk#, SWF, Cocoa#...)
	* MonoDevelop plugin

* Framework additions to
	* support inclusion/exclusion of rules
	* support ignore list(s)

* Gendarme icon/logo

* Integration into MonoBuild

* Apply rule results into Mono class libraries, tools ...

* Add SourceText support to gendarme

	The Console Runner should display the coresspondening source
	lines to a message. There are 3 types of message need to be taken
	care of. IMHO an example output should look like
	
	1) Method and Instruction based messages.
	
	Source Text (regarding UseStringEmptyRule)
	
	  File: C:\Development\mono\gendarme\console\ConsoleRunner.cs
	  
		005	public void Foo () {
		006		Console.WriteLine ("");
		-------------------------^^
		007	}
	
		That's pretty easy, Instruction has a ServicePoint which
		points to a Start/End-Line/Column.
		
	2) Member based messages.
 
	Source Text
	
	  File: C:\Development\mono\gendarme\console\ConsoleRunner.cs
	  
	  007 /// </summary>
		008	public void Foo (out bar) {
		---------------------^^^
		009		bar = null		
		010	}
	
		I've yet to find a way to get a ServicePoint out of a Method-
		declaration so that's pretty hard to display. A solution might
		be taking the first instruction of a method, but what offset shall
		we calculate? 1 line above the instruction?
		
		
	3) Type/Module or Assembly based messages
	
		Source Text
	
	  File: C:\Development\mono\gendarme\console\ConsoleRunner.cs
	  
	  007 /// </summary>
		008	public class Foo {		
		009		
		010
		
		What to display if a type/module or assembly rule is hit and no member is specified?
		The class header? How to identifiy it (Cecil has no TypeDefinition::ServicePoint
		property).
		
	Other to that it should be discussed wether this is part of the Framework or a think
	runners should take care of.
