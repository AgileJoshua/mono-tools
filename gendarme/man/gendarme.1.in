.TH Gendarme "Gendarme @GENDARME_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
Gendarme \- Rule-based code analysis for Mono.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B gendarme [--config configfile] [--set ruleset] [--log file | --xml file | --html file] [options] assemblies ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGendarme\fP is a extensible rule-based tool used to find problems in .NET 
applications and libraries. Gendarme inspects programs and libraries that
contain code in ECMA CIL format (Mono and .NET) and looks for common 
problems with the code, problems that compilers do not typically check or
have historically not checked.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "--config configfile"
Specify the rule sets and rule settings. Default is 'rules.xml'.
.TP
.I "--set ruleset"
Specify a rule set from configfile. Defaults to 'default'.
.TP
.I "--log file"
Save the report to the specified file. If none of --log, --xml, or --html are used
then the report is written to stdout.
.TP
.I "--xml file"
Save the report, formatted as XML, to the specified file.
.TP
.I "--html file"
Save the report, formatted as HTML, to the specified file.
.TP
.I "--ignore ignore-file"
Do not report defects listed in the specified file.
.TP
.I "--limit N"
Stop reporting after N defects are found.
.TP
.I "--severity [all | audit[+] | low[+|-] | medium[+|-] | high[+|-] | critical[-]],...
Filter the reported defects to include the specified severity levels.
Default is 'medium+' (i.e. low and audit levels are ignored).
.TP
.I "--confidence [all | low[+] | normal[+|-] | high[+|-] | total[-]],...
Filter the reported defects to include the specified confidence levels.
Default is 'normal+' (i.e. low level is ignored).
.TP
.I "--quiet"
Used to disable progress and other information which is normally written to stdout.
.TP
.I "--v|verbose"
When present additional progress information is written to stdout. May be used
more than once to write even more info. 
.TP
.I "--version"
Display Gendarme's version number. This will match the Mono version number
that this copy of Gendarme was released with.
.TP
.I "assemblies ..."
Specify the assemblies to verify. You can specify multiple filenames, 
including masks (? and *). You can also provide a file that lists several
assemblies (one per line) by prefixing the filename with @ on the command 
line.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ignore-file
This file is used to filter out defects from gendarme reports. It uses a line oriented
file format where the first characters of the line control the interpretation of the line:
.RS
# - means that the line is a comment.
.RE
.RS
R: - if the full name of a rule to be filtered.
.RE
.RS
A: - is used to filter out an assembly (the extension can be omitted).
.RE
.RS
T: - is used to filter out a namespace qualified type name.
.RE
.RS
M: - is used to filter out a method. It must contain the full method name as it appears in the report.
.RE

.TP
.I rules.xml
This file is used in conjunction with the --set option to control and configure the rules
used by Gendarme. It contains a set of named rules (rule sets) and each rule set contains 
a list of rules. Rules have required from and include attributes, optional exclude and
applyTo attributes, and optional parameter child elements.

The from attribute is the path of a dll to load ("Gendarme.Rules.BadPractice.dll").
Relative paths are relative to the gendarme executable.

The include attribute may be "*" to match every rule in the dll or a list of rule names
separated by '|' ("WhizBangRule | MyRule").

The exclude attribute is a list of rule names separated by '|' ("IckyRule").
These will override any rules matched by the include attribute.

The applyTo attribute may be "all", "visible", or "nonvisible". If it is all (the default) then
all types in the assemblies are checked, if it is visible then only the externally visible
types are checked, if it is nonvisible then only the internally visible types are checked.

The parameter child element is used to customize the behavior of a rule within a dll.
It has three required attributes: rule, property, and value. rule is the name of the
applicable rule ("AvoidSmallNamespaceRule"), property is the name of a public
property in the rule ("Minimum"), value is the value to assign to the property ("10").
.TP
.I gendarme.exe.config
Used by debug versions of Gendarme to enable logging for rules. A config
file will be generated automatically by the make file. To enable logging
for a rule edit the config file, add a switch using the rule's name, and set the 
value to 1.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.I GENDARME_COLOR
The runner will use colors when displaying defects on the console. 
By default colors are dark in order to display correctly on any 
background. You can change this default to "light" (lighter colors 
looks nice on a dark background, or "none" so no colors will be used.
E.g.
.nf
    GENDARME_COLOR=none gendarme ...
