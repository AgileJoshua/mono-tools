	* History.cs: Remove history, will implement a different system than
	  the bash-like system.  This model does not match.
	* Main.cs: Use a cool trick from Alan McGovern to guess whether the
	  host application had Gtk running or not.

	Added new files for a GUI Gtk# csharp command line interpreter,
	based on Aaron's BooShell for Banshee and the `csharp' command
	line tool.

	The idea is to turn this into a module that can be attached into
	Gtk# applications.
