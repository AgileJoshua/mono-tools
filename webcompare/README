To try this out:

	* Unpack one of the masterinfos in this directory (this needs
          to be changed to be versioned later), and move it into masterinfos/VERS
	  where VERS is 1.1, 2.0, SL2 or 3.5

	* Symlink your $prefix/lib/mono to the binary directory.

	* Run xsp2 on this directory.

	* Visit: http://localhost:8080/index.aspx

To check different assemblies use:

	* http://localhost:8080/index.aspx?assembly=ANAME

TODO:

	Some extra attributes [+] do not seem to propagate up to its
	container so the info is not shown, it should be shown as a
	warning for example:

	Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine.dll
	   Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine
	       class Target
	           GetEnumerator 
		       [+] EXTRA ATTRIBUTE

        The GetEnumerator has no flag indicating that it has stuff
        that should not be there.

TOPIC:

	Should extra attributes be reported *at all*?

Hidding attributes:

	DebuggerDisplayAttribute can probably be safely ignored, and
	so is DebuggerHiddenAttribute, and in fact, anything with
	Debugger probably can be ignored if it is a [+].
