To try this out:

	* Unpack one of the masterinfos in this directory (this needs
          to be changed to be versioned later), it should only contain
	  a directory masterinfos/ here.

	* Run xsp2 on this directory.

	* Visit: http://localhost:8080/index.aspx

	* Edit the Global.asax to replace the hardcoded /mono/lib/mono directory
	  with your own $prefix/lib/mono directory

To check different assemblies use:

	* http://localhost:8080/index.aspx?assembly=ANAME
