To try this out:

	* Unpack one of the masterinfos in this directory (this needs
          to be changed to be versioned later), and move it into masterinfos/VERS
	  where VERS is 1.1, 2.0, SL2 or 3.5

	* Symlink your $prefix/lib/mono to the binary directory.

	* Run xsp2 on this directory.

	* Visit: http://localhost:8080/index.aspx

To check different assemblies use:

	* http://localhost:8080/index.aspx?assembly=ANAME
