	* CallsStore.cs: add child node compression for filtered libraries.
	Retrieves a list of filtered libraries from the DisplayOptions and 
	"flattens" library calls within the set to hide internal implementation
	nodes.  Prunes the tree to better visualize user code.
	* DisplayOptions.cs: initial pass at a filtering options class. Adds
	ShowSystemNodes option and first pass at a Filters array for filtered
	libraries which will be user configurable eventually.
	* ProfileView.cs: replace Type prop and set_LogFile with a LoadProfile
	method to make the operation atomic.
	* *.cs : hooks to enable DisplayOptions.

	to the profiler invocation.  Supports alloc and calls switches as
	well as selecting assembly to execute.
	* ProfileView.cs: add ProfileType prop to support explicit view setup.
	Conditionally construct child view type when LogFile is set.
