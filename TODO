mono-tools TODO list:
--------------------

Write a .spec file to generate mono-tools.rpm.

Write a configure script.  It should:
  - Invoke the debugger's `autogen.sh' file
  - Check for a C# compiler
  - Check for `jay'
  - Handle the installation prefix

The configure script should hand all of the above info the the debugger's
autogen.sh (which may require mangling of some form).

It should also generate top-level makefiles which record the prefix.

This should allow makefile-based projects (like type-reflector) to be
installed without always specifying the prefix, as that would be maintained by
the mono-tools makefiles.
